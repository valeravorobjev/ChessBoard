# ChessBoard package for SwiftUI

The package contains a checkerboard for the swift ui. Supported devices such as: ios, ipados    , macos.

This project is under development. Please temporarily refrain from using it.

Hey, guys! I started this project by learning the wonderful Swift programming language.

To learn the language better, I created this repository as a learning project. Ideally, I wanted to create a chessboard engine that can be used in various chess projects.

But as it usually happens, I'm burned out and I don't want to work on this project anymore. And there is not much time.

Unfortunately, the project remained unfinished. But it's not a big deal, if you have a desire, then you can offer pull requests with modifications and changes. Thanks!

This project is a package, so theoretically it can be added to your chess project. But since this package is not ready, it is better not to do it.
